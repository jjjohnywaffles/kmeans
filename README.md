### **Background**

This project is designed to further my understanding of advanced data analysis techniques, a field that fascinates me and aligns closely with my career aspirations. By implementing KMeans clustering and predictive modeling, I am deepening my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. This program not only serves as a practical application of my analytical skills but also bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.

Through this project, I am exploring how data-driven strategies can shape marketing and business decisions. The skills I am acquiring, such as behavioral prediction, will significantly contribute to my professional growth in data science. Furthermore, developing a personal website to showcase this work will highlight my commitment to sharing my expertise and building a comprehensive professional portfolio.

### **Methodology, Materials, and Methods**

This project employed a combination of data science techniques and web development tools to achieve its objectives. The methodology involved leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for processing and visualizing data. Customer segmentation was performed using KMeans clustering, and predictive analytics were enhanced with a Random Forest model to identify purchasing behaviors.

The materials included a shopping trends dataset, a python file to run the program, a jupyter notebook to quickly debug code, and visualization tools such as PowerBI and Tableau to examine the dataset. For web development, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The methods incorporated data preprocessing, clustering, and building predictive models while integrating web design to present my work professionally.

### **Results**

#### **What Did I Learn?**

Over the course of this project, I better understood clustering techniques and learned how to integrate KMeans with Random Forest models to create powerful predictive analytics tools. While at first these topics were incredibly confusing, eventually understanding how to utilize various libraries together definitely aided me in my journey. These methods allowed me to effectively segment customers and anticipate their purchasing behaviors. Alongside this, I also greatly deepened my understanding of how predictive analysis can drive marketing decision through numerous real-life use cases for these methods. 
 
Furthermore, the development of my personal website was definitely a journey I started from scratch. Before this semester, I had never written a single line of code in either html, css or javascript. However, while also taking the Software Development class where I was first exposed to web development, I decided to put together a portfolio website, something I planned to do for quite a while. Over the course of the semester, I learned all three languages in order to put together my website. While using a starting template definitely expedited the process, making numerous adjustments required me to code in all three languages which definitely gave me hands-on experience with web development. 

#### **How Do I Know I Learned It?**

I believe my learning is most evident through the successful launch of my personal website. My website not only hosts a plethora of information regarding my own social network, but also holds links to numerous of my previous projects which anyone can check out. Furthermore, I tried to add touches of animation to the site to make it seem much more interactive. My data analysis progressiong is also most evident through the successful implementation of a Python program that accurately clusters customers and predicts their purchasing likelihood. THe functionality of the program demonstrates my grasp on both clustering and predictive modeling techniques. While I know that it definitely can be improved, it currently does what I planned on throughout the semester. 


#### **Project Assessments**

The customer segmentation model developed during this project is functional and provides actionable insights. Similarly, the personal website meets all formatting and functionality goals, serving as a portfolio for my work. I hope that both components of this project showcase my technical proficiency and creative ability to integrate data science with professional presentation.


### **Discussion / Reflection**

#### **Did You Meet Your Goals?**

I believe I successfully achieved my project goals. The clustering model effectively segments customers, providing insights that can inform personalized marketing strategies. Predictive analytics enhanced with Random Forest models offer insights into customer behaviors utlizing Kmeans clustering. However, this does not mean it can't be improved. As of now, the scope of the analysis tool is quite limited and I want to expand the program to perhaps utilize machine learning as intended through my project propsal. Due to limited time, I was unable to integrate a machine learning model thus decided to simplify my project overall to utilize a Kmeans Clustering. 

Additionally, the personal website I developed comprehensively showcases my work alongside any methods of contact. 

#### **Success Factors**

Key factors that contributed to my success include a consistent learning schedule and effective resource management. This semester was definitely the most difficult semester within the program, having taken 4 classes. The need to constantly provide project updates provided me the opportunity to better handle my time since I always wanted to have some meaningful update for the week. Thus this ensured that I was making consistent progress, even if I did end up a little short of my overall goal. Furthermore, utilizing Python libraries for efficient data processing and visualization tools for insightful analytics definitely enabled me to achieve my goals within the given timeframe since they expedited the calculation aspect of the program.

#### **Challenges**

Despite the successes, I faced challenges, particularly due to limited prior exposure to machine learning concepts. While I was unable to utilize these machine learning concepts, understanding and applying these advanced techniques required significant effort and learning. Balancing the complexity of the project with other commitments was another challenge that required careful time management due to my incredibly busy schedule. 

#### **Future Improvements**

Looking ahead, I plan to dedicate more time to mastering advanced machine learning techniques, which will allow me to enhance the predictive capabilities of my models. Additionally, I aim to integrate more diverse datasets to provide broader customer profiling and deeper insights. These future improvements will strengthen the impact and applicability of my work. Furthermore, I intend to continuously update my personal website to include new features and interactive projects. As of now, I have only included one interactive project from another class I am currently taking. I am definitely motivated to add more to the website.

### **Conclusion**

Reflecting on this semester, this project has solidified my passion for data science and web development. The skills and knowledge I have acquired during this time have expanded my technical capabilities and my ability to integrate analytical approaches into practical applications. Moving forward, I intend to utilize these newly developed skills in both academic and professional settings. I hope that this project alongside my previous professional experience working in data analytics will better prepare me for a future occupation in the field. 

Additionally, the web development component of this project has equipped me with the tools necessary to present myself effectively. This will be invaluable as I continue to build a professional portfolio that showcases my ability to combine technical expertise with clear communication.
